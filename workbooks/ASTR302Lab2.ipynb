An example where the distribution is limited is a counting experiment because the counts cannot be $<$ 0. This situation can become particular extreme if the expected counts are quite small, i.e. near 0. For this we use the Poisson distribution and the uncertainties can be calculated in a similar manner (using either the integral or sampling approaches) but there is also a simple prescritpion that works roughly, which is that $\\sigma = \\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of events. For example, if the mean is 10 events, then you can quote 10$\\pm \\sqrt{10}$. Because photon flux rates tend to be small, Poissonian error estimates are often used in this context - but be careful, because they are not quite mathematically correct."
